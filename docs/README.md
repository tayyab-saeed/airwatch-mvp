## üéì Project Concept: AirWatch

### What It Does
AirWatch is a web application that:
1. Predicts air quality (PM2.5, NO2, O3) in real-time
2. Forecasts aviation safety conditions
3. Provides actionable insights for airlines, airports, and the public
4. Visualizes predictions on an interactive map

### Why It Matters
- **Airlines**: Optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption
- **Airports**: Manage operations, improve safety
- **Public**: Plan outdoor activities, protect health
- **Regulators**: Monitor compliance, enforce standards

### Technical Approach
- **Data**: NASA MODIS, MERRA-2, Sentinel-5P, OpenAQ
- **ML**: XGBoost for air quality, Random Forest for safety
- **Frontend**: React + Leaflet maps + Recharts
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

| Data access blocked | Low | Use OpenAQ instead of NASA |
| Model doesn't train | Medium | Use simpler model (Linear Regression) |
| Frontend-backend mismatch | High | Use mock data first |
| Team member unavailable | Low | Cross-train, document daily |

## üí° Pro Tips from Past Winners

1. **Deploy early** - Don't wait until Day 2
2. **Use mock data** - Frontend shouldn't wait for backend
3. **Keep it simple** - Working basic > broken advanced
4. **Test on mobile** - Judges will use phones
5. **Tell a story** - Connect with real-world impact
6. **Practice demo** - At least 3 times
7. **Have fun** - Energy and passion matter!

---

## üéØ Decision Framework

### Should we add this feature?
**YES** if:
- Takes < 2 hours to implement
- Core to the demo
- Judges will definitely notice

**NO** if:
- Takes > 4 hours
- Edge case or nice-to-have
- Not visible in 5-minute demo

### Backend vs Frontend issue?
**Backend**: Wrong data, API errors, slow
**Frontend**: Display issues, layout, clicks
**Integration**: Data format, CORS, types
